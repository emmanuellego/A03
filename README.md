=================

Git is a software development tracker that tracks the changes made in projects using repositories that can be cloned (copied) to a client's computer and pushed (updated) to the online repository created on GitHub. In order to utilize Git, you must know how to do the following steps:

1) Create a repository on either GitHub or on your computer by creating a new folder to store files in.
1.5) If the repository is created on GitHub, <b>clone</b> the repository onto your computer.
2) Once the repository is made or cloned, you can begin working on the software or, if you created the repository within an existing directory on your computer, push all changes to the header.
3) After pushing changes to the header, commit all files to the repository.

If another person is working on a separate branch of the repository, or remote repository, you can <b>fetch</b> the changes in their repository without merging your repositories.

However, if you don't want to only just fetch the repository, you can <b>merge</b> the repositories together. But be careful, you can cause a merge conflict if you change similar lines in the same file.
